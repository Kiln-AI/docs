### Step 1: Download and Install

MacOS and Windows: download the [latest release](https://github.com/Kiln-AI/Kiln/releases/latest). Be sure to download the correct version (Windows, Mac for Apple Silicon, Mac for Intel).

[![Download button](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a5d51b8b-b30a-4a16-a902-ab6ef1d58dc0)](https://github.com/Kiln-AI/Kiln/releases/latest)

Next, install the app:

* macOS: open the .dmg file, and drag the app to your Applications directory
* Windows: double click the installer, and follow the guide to install
* Linux: we suggest the installation command below.

{% code overflow="wrap" %}

<summary>Windows Installer Troubleshooting</summary>

If you have any issues installing on Windows, check the solutions below:

* "Unrecognized App" warning: this warning may appear after we ship a new app update. This is just a warning. To bypass it, click "More Info" and continue the install.
* Anti-virus blockers: every release is scanned for viruses using [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload), a comprehensive scanner that scans the app with over 70 virus scanners. Occasionally McAfee/AVG/Avast has a false positive (detects a virus when there isn't one). Feel free to scan the installer yourself (using VirusTotal or similar tool); once you trust the installer, add it to your virus scanner's allow-list.

The app will guide you through creating a project, creating a task, and connecting to AI providers like Ollama and OpenAI.&#x20;

Try our sample task for a quick exploration, or define your own custom task for your project.
