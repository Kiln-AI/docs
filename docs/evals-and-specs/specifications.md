### What are Kiln Specs?&#x20;

Kiln Specs combine 3 of Kiln's best features into an interactive tool: evals, synthetic data generation and copilot. Together they goes beyond making an eval manually in several ways:

* **Identify Gaps**: Kiln will read your judge prompt and help refine it. We detect underspecified aspects of your judge, conflicts with your task definition, ambiguous requests that Judges may struggle with and more common issues. It will generate few-shot examples for your judge to help improve judge consistency and reliability.
* **Interactive Human Alignment**: Getting a LLM-as-Judge to align to a human isn't easy. Human judges make subtle and subjective decisions, and have a hard time articulate exactly why in a way LLMs can duplicate. Our alignment loop finds tough edge cases, and confirms the LLM judge and human judge are aligned. Work with Kiln Copilot iteratively to reduce and eliminate any gaps.
* **Automatic Synthetic Data**: Build robust synthetic dataset for evals and training in seconds
* **Judge Meta-prompting**: The best way to descrive a issue isn't always the best judge prompt. Our judge meta-prompting takes you issues, and turns them into functional evals.
* **Easy to Use**: no data-science background needed. Kiln's copilot will walk you through all the steps of defining your judge, creating synthetic data, aligning your judge, and creating training datasets.
* **Fast**: creating a Spec can be done in as little as 5 minutes, compared to over 30 minutes for an eval.

### How to Get Started

Creating a Spec is easy:

* Open the Kiln App to any task
* Click "Specs & Evals" in the sidebar
* Click "Create Spec"
