# Evals & Specs

#### Overview

Kiln has two powerful features to ensure your AI systems perform as expected, drive optimizations and don't regress in quality:

* [**Evaluations**](evaluations.md): powerful AI evals, made easy.&#x20;
* **Specifications \[Coming Soon]:** Work with Kiln's Copilot to build optimal specifications for agent behaviour, including automatically generating optimal evals/judges.

#### Guides

* [Evals 101](evaluations.md): build your first eval start to finish&#x20;
* [Evaluate RAG Accuracy](evaluate-rag-accuracy-q-and-a-evals.md): Kiln can generate custom Q\&A evals which test your RAG with knowledge from your documents
* [Evaluate Tool Use](evaluate-appropriate-tool-use.md): ensure your agents are using the right tools, at the right time, with the right parameters with tool use evals
