<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/eval_header.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### Overview

Kiln includes a complete platform for ensuring your tasks/models are of the highest possible quality. It includes:

* Access multiple SOTA evaluation algorithms (G-Eval, LLM as Judge)
* Compare and benchmark your judges against human evals to find the best possible evaluator for your use case
* Test a variety of different methods of running your task (prompts, models, fine-tunes) to find which perform best
* Easily manage datasets for eval sets, golden sets, human ratings through our intuitive UI, including automatic synthetic data generation.
* Generate evaluators automatically. Using your task definition we'll create an evaluator for your task's overall score and task requirements
* Utilize built-in eval templates for toxicity, bias, jailbreaking, and other common eval scenarios
* Integrate evals with the rest of Kiln: use synthetic data generation to build eval sets, or use evals to evaluate fine-tunes
* Optional: Python Library Usage

### Concepts Overview

This is a quick summary of all of the concepts in creating evals with Kiln:

* Eval (aka Evaluator): defines an evaluation goal (like "overall score" or "toxicity"), and includes dataset definitions to use for running this eval. You can add many evals to a task, each for different goals.
* Score: an output score for an eval like "overall score", "toxicity" or "helpfulness". An eval can have 1 or more output scores. These have a score type: 1-5 star, pass/fail, or pass/fail/critical.
* Judges: methods of running an Eval. A judge includes a judge algorithm, judge instructions, and judge model/provider. An eval can have many judges, and Kiln will help you compare them to find which judge best correlates to human preferences.
* Task Run Methods: methods of running your task. A task run method includes a prompt, model, model provider and options (temperature, top\_p, etc). A task can have many run methods. Once you have an Eval, you can use it to find an optimal run-method for your task: the run method which scores the highest, using your eval.

### Creating an Eval

From the "Eval" tab in Kiln's UI, you can easily create a new evaluator.

#### Pick a Goal / Select a Template

Kiln has a number of built-in templates to make it easy to get started.

{% hint style="info" %}
We recommend starting with the "Overall Score and Task Requirements" template and "Issue" template for bugs.
{% endhint %}

* **Overall Score and Task Requirement Scores:** Generate scores for the requirements you set up when you created this task, plus an overall-score. These can be compared to human ratings from the dataset UI.
* **Kiln Issue Template**: evaluate an issue or bug you've seen in your task. You'll describe the issue and provide examples. Kiln will help generate synthetic data to reproduce the issue which can help you ensure your fix works. For advanced issues, Kiln can generate synthetic training data for fine-tuning a model to avoid this issue.
* **Built-in Templates**: Kiln includes a number of common templates for evaluating AI systems. These include evaluator templates for measuring **toxicity, bias, maliciousness, factual correctness, and jailbreak susceptibility**.
* **Custom Goal and Scores**: If the templates aren't a good fit, feel free to create your own Eval from scratch using the custom option. However, prefer the "issue" template where possible as it's integrated into synthetic data generation.

Select a template, edit if desired, and save your eval.

### Add a Judge to your Eval

The Eval you created defines the goal of the eval, but it doesn't include the specifics of how it's run. That's where judges come in — they define the exact approach of running an eval. This includes things like the judge algorithm, the judge model/provider, and judge prompt.

#### Select a judge model & provider

Select the model you want the judge to use (including which AI provider it should be run on).

{% hint style="info" %}
We suggest larger high quality models for judges, as you'll be trusting their results to make product improvements. You can always run a cheaper/smaller model for inference which is where the majority of compute is spent in most projects.
{% endhint %}

#### Select an Judge Algorithm

Kiln supports two powerful eval algorithms:

_**LLM as Judge**_

Just like the name says, this approach uses LLMs to judge the output of your task. It combines a "thinking" stage (chain of thought/reasoning), followed by asking the model to produce a score rubric matching the goals you laid out in the eval.

_**G-Eval**_

G-Eval is an enhanced form of LLM as Judge. It looks at token output probabilities (logprobs) to create a weighted score. For example, if the model had a 51% chance of passing an eval and 49% chance of failing it, G-Eval will give the more nuanced score of 0.51, where LLM-as-Judge would simply pass it (1.0). The [G-Eval paper (Liu et al)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16634) compares G-eval to a range of alternatives (BLEU, ROUGE, embedding distance scores), and shows it can outperform them across a range of eval tasks.

{% hint style="info" %}
Since G-Eval requires logprobs (individual token probabilities), only a limited set of models work with G-Eval. Currently it only works best with OpenAI models GPT-4o, GPT-4o mini, GPT 4.1, etc.

The UI will only show G-Eval if you select a supported model + provider.

Unfortunately [Ollama doesn't support logprobs yet](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/issues/2415).
{% endhint %}

<details>

<summary><strong>Using models to evaluate models? Does that really work?</strong></summary>

Your intuition might be that you can't use LLMs to evaluate LLM tasks. Won't they make the same errors during evaluation that they make running your task?

There's a few reasons this approach actually works quite well:

* You can use better/larger models during evaluations: evals are (typically) run less often than the task itself. You can use larger models during evals, to gain trust in your smaller/faster task model.
* You can use more inference time compute during evaluation. Evals can be run with advanced reasoning models or detailed chain-of-thought instructions during eval, since latency and cost matter less during evals (they are run less often, and your users aren't waiting for an answer). In particular, defining specialized eval prompts covering specific error cases to watch for, multi-shot examples and rating guidance can really help evals outperform the core task model.
* Often we see the best model at evaluating a task is not the best model at running the task. Using the best model for each job can improve your overall system.

</details>

#### Advanced: Customize a Task Description

The evaluator model can almost always perform better if you give it a high level summary of the task. Keep this short, usually just one sentence. We'll add more detailed asks of the evaluators in the next section.

This will be pre-populated from your eval, and customizing it is optional.

#### Advanced: Customize Evaluation Steps / Thinking Steps

Both Kiln eval algorithms give the model time to "think" using chain-of-thought/reasoning before generating the output scores. Your judge defines an ordered list of evaluation instructions/steps, giving the model steps for "thinking through" the eval prior to answering. If you selected a template when creating the eval, Kiln will automatically fill in template steps for you. You can edit the templates as much as you wish, adding, removing and editing steps.

This will be pre-populated from your eval, and customizing it is optional.

<details>

<summary>Advanced tactics for defining eval steps</summary>

If you start editing the eval's steps, here are some advanced tactics/guidance that can help improve your eval performance:

* Include Multi-shot examples: for a step, give examples of different outputs and how they should be scored. Be sure to not include examples in your eval datasets.
* If your eval has multiple output scores, include at least 1 step for each score.
* Consider order of your steps: start with the more independent considerations, before moving to holistic considerations. For example, instructions for generating a final "overall score" should come after all other thinking steps.
* Consider short-circuit exits and limits: for example "If this step results in a failure, always return a 1-star overall score." or "If this step fails, the maximum overall score you should return is 3-stars".
* Consider weighting guidance for overall scores: if you have many steps producing an overall score, tell the LLM which steps matter the most.

</details>

#### Python Library Usage \[optional]

It's possible to create evals in code as well. Just be aware judges are called EvalConfigs in our library.

### Create your Eval Datasets

An eval in Kiln includes two datasets:

* **Eval dataset**: specifies which part of your dataset is used when evaluating different methods of running your task.
* **Golden dataset**: specifies which part of your dataset is used when trying to find the best judge for this task. This dataset will have human ratings, so we can compare judges to human preference.

This section will walk you through populating both of your eval datasets.

#### Defining your Dataset with Tags

When first creating your eval, you will specify a "tag" which defines each eval dataset as a subset of all the items in Kiln's Dataset tab. To add/remove items from your datasets, simply add/remove the corresponding tag. These tags can be added or removed anytime from the "Dataset" tab.

Don't worry if your dataset is empty when creating your eval, we'll guide you through adding data after its creation.

By default, Kiln will suggest appropriate tags and we suggest keeping the defaults. For example, the overall-score template will use the tags "eval\_set" and "golden", while the toxicity template will use the tags "toxicity\_eval\_set" and "toxicity\_golden".

{% hint style="info" %}
"Golden" is a term often used in data science, to describe a "gold standard" dataset, used to compare different methods/approaches.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
If you're creating multiple evals for task, it's usually beneficial to maintain separate datasets for each eval. For example, a "toxicity" eval dataset will likely be filled with negative content you wouldn't want in your overall-score eval. Kiln will suggest goal-specific tags by default.
{% endhint %}

#### Populating the Dataset with Synthetic Data

Most commonly, you'll want to populate the datasets using synthetic data. Clicking `Add Eval Data` then `Synthetic Data` from the Evals UI; this will launch the synthetic data gen tool with the proper [eval tags](./#defining-your-dataset-with-tags) already populated. See our [synthetic data generation guide](../synthetic-data-generation.md) for details on generating synthetic data.

We suggest at least 160 data samples per eval. Difficult or subjective tasks may require more.

An appropriate data gen template will be populated when you enter data-gen via an eval. You can customize this template to guide data generation. See [the docs](../synthetic-data-generation.md#automatic-templates-and-custom-prompting) for details.

{% hint style="info" %}
Golden eval datasets work best if they have a range of ratings (some pass, some fail, some of each star-score).

If your dataset doesn't have enough variation, you may see "N/A" scores when comparing evaluators.

If after rating your golden set doesn't a range of content (for example, one score always passes or always fails), generate some additional content for the missing cases. You can use human guidance to do this, see "Guidance Templates" below for examples.
{% endhint %}

#### Tagging the Eval Datasets

If you've launched the synthetic data generator from the evals UI, it will know to assign the needed tags in the apppriopiate ratio. There's no need to manually tag dataset items.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2025-07-16 at 12.52.18 PM.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Data gen will populate target tags when launched from Evals</p></figcaption></figure>

<details>

<summary>Adding tags manually</summary>

If your dataset items weren't automatically tagged for any reason, you can also add tags manually:

1. Add your data to Kiln using one of the import options ([CSV import](../organizing-datasets.md#importing-data-into-your-dataset), [python library import](../../developers/python-library-quickstart.md))
2. Open the "Dataset" tab in kiln
3. Filter your dataset to only the content you want to tag. For example, synthetic data is tagged with an automatic tag such as synthetic\_session\_12345, CSV imports have similar tags.
4. Use the "Select" UI to select a portion of your dataset for your eval-dataset. 80% is a good starting point. Add the tag for your eval dataset, which is "eval\_config" if you kept the default tag name. Note: if you generated data using synthetic "topics", make sure to include a mix of each topic in each sub-dataset.
5. Select only the remaining items, and add the tag for your golden dataset, which is "golden" if you kept the default tag name (or something like "toxicity\_golden" if you used a different template than the default).
6. Filter the dataset to both tags (eval\_config and golden) to double check you didn't accidentally add any items to both datasets.

</details>

{% hint style="info" %}
**Validation Set**

For rigorous AI evaluation, you'll want to add a third set as well: a validation set. This set is reserved until the end, so your final assessment isn't contaminated by seeing early results from the test set (eval\_set).

You can create this set now, or generate it later.
{% endhint %}

#### Add Human Ratings

Next we'll add human ratings, so we can measure how well our eval judge performs compared to a human. If you have a subject matter expert for your task, get them to perform this step. See our [collaboration guide](../collaboration.md) for how to work together on a Kiln project.

The `Rate Golden Dataset` button in the eval screen will take you to the dataset view filtered to your golden dataset (the items which need ratings). Once fully rated, this will get a checkmark and you can proceed to the next step

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2025-06-27 at 11.13.51 AM.png" alt="" width="375"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

{% hint style="success" %}
You can use the left/right keyboard keys to quickly move between items. Only the golden dataset needs ratings, not the eval\_set.
{% endhint %}

### Finding the Ideal Judge

{% hint style="info" %}
**Who Judges the Judge?**

While it is relatively easy to create a LLM-as-Judge eval, an important question remains — does it actually work?

In this section we use a human judge's ratings to ensure our LLM-as-Judge aligns to human ratings, so we have trust in our system.
{% endhint %}

You added a Judge to your eval above. However, we don't actually know how well this judge works. Kiln includes tools to compare multiple judges, and find which one is the closest to a real human evaluator.

It may seem strange, but yes… one of the first steps of building an eval is to judge judges (not a typo). It sounds complicated, but Kiln makes it easy.

#### Run Evals on your Golden Set

Open your eval from the "Evals" tab, then click the "Compare Judges" button. From the "Compare Judges" screen, click the "Run Eval" button.

This will run your eval on the golden dataset, once with each judge.

Once complete, you'll have a set of metrics about how well the judge's scoring matched human scores.

#### Add Judges and Compare to Find the Best

One score in isolation isn't helpful. You'll want to add additional judges to see which one performs best. Kiln makes it easy to compare judges. We suggest trying a range of options:

* Try both judge types: G-Eval and LLM as Judge
* Try a range of different models: you may be surprised which model works best as an evaluator for your task. Be sure to try SOTA models, like the latest models from OpenAI and Anthropic. Even if you prefer open models, it can be good to know how far you are from these benchmarks.
* Try custom eval instructions, not just the template contents.

Once you've added multiple judges, you can compare scores to find the best evaluator for your task. You're looking for the score which appears highest in the table, which means the least deviation from human scores. On some scoring methods higher scores are better (Kendall's, Spearman) and on others lower is better (MSE, MAE); the table will be sorted so the best are at the top.

#### Understanding Correlation Scores

There's no benchmark good/bad score for an evaluator; it all depends on your task difficulty.

For an easy and highly deterministic task, you might be able to find many judges which achieve near perfect scores, even with small eval models and default prompts.

For a highly subjective task, it's likely no evaluator will perfectly match the human scores, even with SOTA models and custom prompts. It's often the case that two humans can't match each other on subjective tasks. Try a range of judges, and pick the one with the best score.

The more subjective the task, the more beneficial a larger and more diverse golden dataset becomes.

<details>

<summary>Technical comparison of score options: Kendall' Tau, Spearman, Pearson, Mean Squared Error, Mean Absolute Error</summary>

> Each score is a correlation score between the judge's scores and the human scores.

**TL;DR**

We suggest you use Kendall Tau correlation scores to compare results.

Kendall Tau scores range from -1.0 to 1, with higher values being higher correlation between the human ratings and the automated judge's scores.

The absolute value of Kendall Tau scores will vary depending on how subjective your task is. Find the highest score for your task, and select it as your default judge.

**Spearman, Kendall Tau, and Pearson Correlation**

_From -1 to 1. Higher is better._

These are three scientific correlation coefficients. For all three, the value tends to be high (close to 1) for samples with a strongly positive correlation, low (close to -1) for samples with a strongly negative correlation, and close to zero for samples with weak correlation. Scores may be 'N/A' if there are too few samples or not enough scoring variation in your human-rated dataset (golden data).

* Spearman evaluates the rank of the scores, not the absolute values.
* Kendall's Tau evaluates rank order of pairs. It is more robust to outliers, handles ties better, and performs better on small datasets. As our datasets often have ties (pass/fail and 5-star datasets have limited discrete values), we suggest Kendall's Tau.
* Pearson evaluates linear correlation.

**Mean Absolute Error**

_Lower is better_

Example: If a human scores an item a 3, and the eval scores it a 5, the absolute error would be 2 \[abs(3-5)]. The overall score is the mean of all absolute errors.

**Normalized Mean Absolute Error**

_Lower is better_

Like mean absolute error, but scores are normalized to the range 0-1. For example, for a 1-5 star rating, 1-star is score 0 and 5-star is score 1.

**Mean Squared Error**

_Lower is better_

Example: If a human scores an item a 3, and the eval scores it a 5, the squared error would be 4 \[(3-5)^2]. The overall score is the mean of all squared errors. This improves over absolute error as it penalizes larger errors more.

**Normalized Mean Squared Error**

_Lower is better_

Like mean squared error, but scores are normalized to the range 0-1. For example, for a 1-5 star rating, 1-star is score 0 and 5-star is score 1.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Resolving "N/A" Correlation Scores</summary>

If you see "N/A" scores in your correlation table, it means more data is needed. This can be one of two cases

* _**Simply not enough data**_: if your golden dataset is very small (<10 items) it can be impossible to produce confident correlation scores. Add more data to resolve this case.
* _**Not enough variation of human ratings in the golden dataset**_: if you have a larger dataset, but still get N/A, it's likely there isn't enough variation in your dataset for the given score. For example, if all of the golden samples of a score pass, the evaluator won't produce a confident correlation score, as it has no failing examples and everything is a tie. Add more content to your golden dataset, designing the content to fill out the missing score ranges. You can use synthetic data gen [human guidance](../synthetic-data-generation.md#human-guidance) to generate examples that fail.

</details>

#### Select the Winning Judge

Once you have a winner, click the "Set as default" button to make this judge the default for your eval.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2025-06-27 at 11.20.02 AM.png" alt="" width="179"><figcaption><p>Select the default judge</p></figcaption></figure>

### Finding the Ideal Run Method

Now that we have an evaluator we trust, we can use it to rapidly evaluate a variety of methods of running our task. We call this a "Run Method" and it includes the model (including fine-tunes), the model provider, and the prompt.

Return to the "Evaluator" screen for your eval, and add a variety of run methods you want to compare. We suggest:

* A range of models (SOTA, smaller, open, etc)
* A range of prompts: both Kiln's [auto-generated prompts](../prompts.md#prompt-generators), and [custom prompts](../prompts.md#custom-prompts-saved-prompts)
* A range of model parameters: temperature, top\_p, etc
* Some model fine-tunes of various sizes, created by [Kiln fine tuning](../fine-tuning/fine-tuning-guide.md)

Once you've defined a set of run methods, click "Run Eval" to kick off the eval. Behind the scenes, this is performing the following steps:

* Fetching the input data from your eval dataset (eval\_set tag)
* Generating new output for each input, using each run method you defined for each input
* Running your evaluator on each result, collecting scores

#### Comparing Run Methods

Once done, you'll have results for how each run method performed on the eval.

These results are easy to interpret compared to the judge comparisons. Each score is simply the average score from that run method. Assuming we want to find the run method that produces the best content, simply find the highest average score.

Congrats! You've used systematic evals to find an optimal method for running your task!

### Comparing Run Methods Over Many Evals

In the last step, you found the ideal run method for a specifc eval. However, over time your team will generate many evals.

When you want to try a new model or prompt, you'll want to make sure the new method is better, not just on a single eval, but across all prior evals.

Kiln's compare view makes it easy to compare run methods across many evals. It also lets you compare the cost difference of each method:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2025-07-17 at 1.39.06 PM (1).png" alt="" width="375"><figcaption><p>Comparing several run methods across all evals</p></figcaption></figure>

Click "Compare" in the evals tab to launch this feature:

### Philosophy: AI Product Evals work Best with Many Small Evals <a href="#setup-team-evals" id="setup-team-evals"></a>

At Kiln we believe if creating an eval takes less than 10 minutes, your team will create them when they spot issues or fix bugs.

When evals become a habit instead of a chore, your AI system becomes dramatically more robust and your team moves faster.

Read our ~~manifesto~~ [guide on how to setup evals for your team](https://kiln.tech/blog/you_need_many_small_evals_for_ai_products#setup-team-evals). It covers:

* Many Small Evals Beat One Big Eval, Every Time
* The Benefits of Many Small Evals
* Evals vs Unit Testing
* 3 Steps to Set Up Your Team for Evals and Iteration

### Next Steps: Iterate and Expand

Congrats, you've found an optimal method of running your task!

However there's always room to improve.

#### Iterate on Methods

You can repeat the processes above to try new judges or run-methods. Through more searching, you may be able to find a better method and improve overall performance.

You can iterate by trying new prompts, more models, building custom fine-tuned models, or trying new state of the art models as they are released.

#### Expand your Dataset

Your understanding of your model/product usually gets better over time. Consider adding data to your dataset over time (both eval\_set and golden). This can come from real users, bug reports, or new synthetic data that comes from a better understanding of the problem. As you add data, re-run both sub-evals (judge and run-method) to find the best judge and run-method for your task.

#### Add New Evals

You can always add additional evals to your Kiln project/task. Try some of our built-in templates like [issue evals](../issues.md), bias, toxicity, factual correctness, or jailbreak susceptibility — or create your own from scratch!

Most commonly, you'll collect a list of ["Issue" evals](../issues.md) over time. This set of evals helps you work with confidence that new changes aren't regressing old issues.

Read out blog [Many Small Evals Beat One Big Eval, Every Time](https://kiln.tech/blog/you_need_many_small_evals_for_ai_products) for a quality strategy that scales as your product and team grow.

### Optional: Python Library Usage

For developers, it's also possible to use evals from our [python library](https://kiln-ai.github.io/Kiln/kiln_core_docs/kiln_ai.html).

Be aware, in our library task run methods are called TaskRunConfigs and judges are called EvalConfigs.

See the EvalRunner, Eval, EvalConfig, EvalRun, and TaskRunConfig classes for details.
