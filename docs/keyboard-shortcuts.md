<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/KBD.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Kiln offers a number of keyboard shortcuts which makes navigating the app easier:

* After opening an dataset item from the "Dataset" screen, use right and left keys to navigate to the next and prior item
* When viewing a dataset item, use the delete key to delete that item
* When on the "Run" screen, you can invoke a run with ctrl-enter on Windows, or Command-return on macOS.
* See the [organizing datasets](organizing-datasets.md) docs page for how to multi-select dataset items
