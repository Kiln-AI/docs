# Keyboard Shortcuts

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/KBD.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Kiln offers a number of keyboard shortcuts which makes navigating the app easier:

* After opening a dataset item from the Dataset screen, use right and left keys to navigate to the next and prior item.
* When viewing a dataset item, use the delete key to delete that item.
* When on the Run screen, you can invoke a run with Ctrl+Enter on Windows, or Command+Return on macOS.
* Elsewhere: wherever you see a keyboard shortcut preview on a button, such as ![](<../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2025-01-09 at 11.40.48â€¯AM (1).png>), you can enter that shortcut to activate the button where the preview appears.
* See the [organizing datasets](organizing-datasets.md) docs page for how to multi-select dataset items
