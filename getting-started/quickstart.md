<summary>Windows Installer Troubleshooting</summary>

If you have any issues installing on Windows, check the solutions below:

* "Unrecognized App" warning: this warning may appear after we ship a new app update. This is just a warning. To bypass it click "More Info" then continue the install.
* Anti-virus blockers: every release is scanned for viruses using [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload), a comprehensive scanner that scans the app with over 70 virus scanners. Occasionally McAfee has a false positive (detects a virus when there isn't one). Feel free to scan the installer yourself (using VirusTotal or similar tool), and once you trust the installer, whitelist it in your virus scanner.
