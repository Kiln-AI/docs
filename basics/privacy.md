# Privacy

Kiln runs on your machine, not a server. We never collect or have access to:

* Datasets / Training Data
* API keys
* Model inputs/outputs (runs)

You can run completely locally using [Ollama](https://ollama.com), in which case your dataset never leaves your device.

If you bring your own keys for an AI provider (OpenAI, OpenRouter, Groq, AWS, etc), see their privacy policy for how they log and store data.

{% hint style="info" %}
We collect anonymous usage metrics via [Posthog analytics](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog).

This analytics data never including dataset content or your identity.&#x20;

Analytics can be blocked with standard ad-blockers.
